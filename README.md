# Advanced House Price Prediction

To develop a machine learning model for predicting the prices of the house based on various features.

Dataset was taken from kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

The dataset consists of 79 features both numerical and categorical features. The main outcome of this project is to practise and expertise different EDA techniques because of the numerous features.

## Appendix

The prerequisite of this project is to have knowledge in different EDA techniques, Feature engineering, machine learning algorithms.
